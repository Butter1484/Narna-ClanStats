Narna Clans Stats!
	The installation for this Simple Clans extension is very simple. You simply add all the files into either the root, or a directory within your Website. I recommend a directory. You can do it without a directory however, the index.php is not mandatory, you can very easily just delete it and use the "SimpleClansStats.php" file as your Clans home page.

	After putting all the files into your selected folder, you need to modify connector.php to contain your MySQL login details (and possibly your DynMap details). I have left some default values in that I assume you might be using. 

	For this web interface to work, you will need to be running SimpleClans in MySQL Mode. To find out how to do this, consult the SimpleClans bukkitdev page: http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/simpleclans/

Thanks, 
	- Drumm of Narna!
